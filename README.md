## Introduction

In a challenge lab youâ€™re given a scenario and a set of tasks to implement inorder to come up with a solution on Google Cloud.

The challenges may include:

- Creating a compute resource eg: Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine etc..
- Configuring a server eg: installing a software
- Designing a network 
- Implementing security

You will use the skills learned during the training & personal research to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own!

You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.
