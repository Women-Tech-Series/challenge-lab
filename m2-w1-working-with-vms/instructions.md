## M2-W1 Challenge Lab: Working with Virtual Machines

### Your challenge
Your company development is building 2 applications one will use Nginx and another Apache2 to serve the app webpages to the internet.

As a cloud engineer recently trained with Google Cloud you have been asked to setup 2 compute engine instances and on one install Nginx and another Apache webserver.

The servers should be accessed over the internet. This means you should setup a firewall rule to allow access to the installed web servers on port 80.

#### Check list:

- Create the vm instances

- Create a firewall

- Install the webservers each on a different vm

- Be able to access the default webserver page over the internet

#### Standards you should follow:

1. Create all resources in the `us-central1` region and `us-central1-a` zone, unless some resources are unavailable in that region

2. Use your name to for your resources to avoid conflicts with other project members resources e.g. an instance could be named `johns-webserver1`

3. Allocate cost effective resource sizes use `e2-medium`
